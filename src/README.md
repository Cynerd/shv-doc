# Introduction

SHV RPC is yust another RPC framework build around ChainPack packing schema.

Why ChainPack? I liked XML atributes, but I dislike fact that XML attributes syntaxe is not XML. 
I like JSON brevity, but you cannot have attributes, comments, utf8 in JSON. ChainPack is
just another attempt to choose the best features from XML and JSON.

ChainPack main features:
* UTF8 string encoding
* every value can have set of named attributes, attributes values are ChainPack again.
